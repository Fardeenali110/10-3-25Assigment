        PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a raster image format that uses lossless compression, preserving image quality. It supports transparency, making it ideal for web design, logos, and icons. Unlike JPEG, PNG does not lose quality after compression and is widely used for high-quality digital images.

        JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a popular image format that uses lossy compression, reducing file size by discarding some image data. It is widely used for photographs and web images due to its balance between quality and compression. However, unlike PNG, JPEG does not support transparency.

    </p>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a vector image format that uses XML-based code to define images. Unlike raster formats like PNG and JPG, SVG images can be resized infinitely without losing quality. It is commonly used for logos, icons, and illustrations on websites. Since SVG files store images as mathematical shapes rather than pixels, they are ideal for responsive web design and animations.

    JPG (or JPEG) is a widely used image format that uses lossy compression to reduce file size while maintaining decent quality. It is ideal for photographs and web images but does not support transparency like PNG. Due to its small file size, it is commonly used for online and digital photography.
