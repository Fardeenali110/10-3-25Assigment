    JPG (or JPEG) stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group,
    the team that created this format. It is one of the most 
    commonly used image formats for digital photography and web
    graphics. JPG images use lossy compression, meaning some image
    quality is lost to reduce file size. The format supports millions
    of colors, making it ideal for detailed images and photographs. 
    JPG files usually have the extensions  and are widely compatible 
    with devices and software. Due to compression, JPG images have 
    smaller file sizes, making them easy to store and share. They are
    not ideal for images requiring , like logos or text-based graphics.
    JPG images do not support transparency, unlike PNG files. They are
    commonly used in websites, social media, and digital cameras.
    Editing and saving a JPG multiple times can reduce its quality
    due to repeated compression.

    SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a popular image format used for
     creating vector-based graphics. Unlike JPG or PNG, SVG images are
      made up of mathematical paths instead of pixels, allowing them to
       be resized without losing quality. This makes them perfect for 
       logos, icons, and web graphics that need to look sharp on any screen.
        Since SVG files are XML-based, they can be edited with code, making
        them customizable and interactive. They also support animation and
        transparency, adding more flexibility to design. SVG files are
        usually smaller in size compared to high-resolution raster
        images, which helps improve website performance. Because they 
        are text-based, search engines can read and index them, making
        them SEO-friendly. However, SVG is not ideal for complex images
        like photographs, as it works best with simple shapes and designs.
        Many modern web technologies, including HTML and CSS, fully 
        support SVG. This format is widely used in web development, 
        graphic design, and UI/UX design.

    PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a popular image format known
     for its high quality and lossless compression. Unlike JPG, PNG
      preserves image details without reducing quality, making it 
      ideal for logos, icons, and digital art. One of its key features
       is support for transparency, allowing images with transparent 
       backgrounds to blend seamlessly into designs. PNG files also
        support millions of colors, making them great for detailed 
        graphics. However, due to lossless compression, PNG file sizes
        are usually larger than JPG files. This format is widely used
        in web design, image editing, and UI/UX development. Since 
        PNG maintains sharp edges and fine details, it is perfect 
        for text-based graphics and illustrations. Unlike SVG, PNG
        is a raster image format, meaning it is made of pixels and
        can lose quality when resized. PNG files are compatible 
        with almost all devices and browsers, making them a reliable 
        choice for high-quality graphics.

    The waves whispered secrets to the shore as the moonlight
     danced on the water. A cool breeze carried the scent of
      blooming jasmine through the quiet night.
